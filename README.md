# Monster Ternary Operator

This repository showcases JavaScript code that uses ternary operators to tackle various challenges related to Monster Energy drinks.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Flavor Selection
Imagine a user has a preference for Monster Energy drinks. We need to determine whether they prefer the "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety. If the preference isn't specified, we default to "Regular."

### Challenge 2: Stock Check
We're keeping track of the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge. If there are fewer than 5 cans, we print "Time to restock!" Otherwise, if there are 5 or more cans, we confidently declare, "We're stocked!"

### Challenge 3: Workout Intensity
Let's consider the user's current heart rate. If it's below 100 beats per minute (bpm), we recommend a Monster Energy drink to boost their workout with a motivational "Boost needed!" message. Otherwise, if the heart rate is 100 bpm or higher, we reassure them with "Energy levels are high!"

### Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability
Based on the current temperature, we decide whether it's suitable to serve Monster Energy drinks. If the temperature is 5°C or below, we confidently state, "Chilled to perfection!" However, if it's above 5°C, we advise, "Needs a cooler!"

### Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
Late-night coding sessions call for a decision. If the current hour falls between 7 am and midnight (in 24-hour format), we enthusiastically encourage the user with "Unleash the beast!" But if it's outside that timeframe, we gently suggest, "Better stick to water."

## Usage
Each challenge solution employs a ternary operator to make decisions based on specific conditions. The provided JavaScript code demonstrates how these concise operators can handle conditional logic effectively.
